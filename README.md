# CMD-WiFi-password
Allows you to retrieve a wifi password from the previously connected network, directly from *cmd*.


# Usage
To run the script and retrieve the password of a previously connected wifi network, follow these instructions :

- Download the *.bat* file from this repository.
- Launch it.
- You have to enter the **exact** name of the wifi network, respecting the case. (eg. Livebox-b464)
- If the script finds a network matching the entered name, the password is displayed.
- (Optionnal) The password can be copied directly to the clipboard by the script.
- ENJOY.

# Know issues
Early stage and pre-release alpha so except some bug and crash.

- [x] ~~Possible error if the network has been registered by WPS.~~
- [x] ~~An error occurs if the SSID contains spaces.~~
- [ ] As the script has only been tested in English and French, it probably only works in these languages. (See [#1][i1])
